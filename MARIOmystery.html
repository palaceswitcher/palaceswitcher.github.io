		<div id="Origin"><h2>Origin</h2>
		<p>"M A R I O" is the name of the person/group who created the <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=6416">MARIO</a> creepypasta hack, a hack known for it's unsettling messages and the disturbing image submitted alongside it (which is apparently taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnroeb5mLV8">a 2008 video</a>). Though the creator's original <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=13790">SMWCentral account</a> was banned from SMWCentral, they have continued to exist on their <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=24537">2nd account</a>, and on other platforms.<br>
		The purpose of this document is to outline the discoveries I've made investigating this ARG and to provide some insight on of their activity.</p></div>
		
		<div id="M A R I O Files"><h2>The Files (M A R I O)</h2>
		
		<p>Time to go over some of the files in their original account. I'm only going to include noteworthy files for obvious reasons.</p>
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/%25C2%25A0.gif">.gif</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/%25C2%25A0.gif"><br>
		No idea what this is or what it could mean.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/hello.mp3">hello.mp3</a></b><br>
		<audio controls><source src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/hello.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio><br>
		An audio recording. If you reverse it and lower it by an octave you can hear a weird noise followed by voice saying "g-1-b-x-24-j-z YouTube had better hurry up." If you search "g1bx24jz" on YouTube, you'll find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3vS6GJU9OdTc1KFsGZsRcg">channel</a> with a video titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ehVvRbzbQ">..wmv</a>". The morse code found in this video translates to "Were you looking for something in particular? You will have to look in a place twenty percent cooler." The latter sentence likely has something to do with MLP.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/made_you_look.gif">made_you_look.gif</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/made_you_look.gif"><br>
		A very strange GIF of a pony with moving billiard balls for eyes. Can't tell what this means either.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/out_of.gif">out_of.gif</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/out_of.gif"><br>
		A scary GIF of a woman flashing in and out. As of right now, I'm unable to determine the source of this image.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/time.gif">time.gif</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/13790/time.gif"><br>
		Another GIF of the same woman, except with the weird billiard ball thing. If you combine the filenames of this and the previous GIF, you get "out of time".</p></div>
		
		<div id="M. A. R. I. O. Files"><h2>The Files (M. A. R. I. O.)</h2>
		<p>Here are the files in the second account. If you were disappointed by the first account, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one.</p>
		
		<!--<p><b><a href=https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/__.png>__.png</a></b><br>
		<img src=https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/__.png width=50% height=50%><br>
		Another weird pony image. The Japanese text is too pixelated to be translated.<br></p>-->
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/_MYHOME.wmv">_MYHOME.wmv</a></b><br>
		A strange video containing a series of triangles and lines. According to the file header it was made in Windows Movie Maker 2.6.4037.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/catherine.wav">catherine.wav</a></b><br>
		<audio controls><source src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/catherine.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><br>
		A loud, frightening audio file. This contains a spectrogram image of a very zombie-like human face.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/combo3.jpg">combo3.jpg</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/combo3.jpg"><br>
		A series of images from the <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/trek/caver/page1.html">Ted the Caver</a> creepypasta.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/floyd.jpg">floyd.jpg</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/floyd.jpg"><br>
		A crudely drawn image, also from <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/trek/caver/page1.html">Ted the Caver</a>. These probably have something to do with the Great Cave Trek hack.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/horror.wav">horror.wav</a></b><br>
		<audio controls><source src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/horror.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><br>
		A hidden spectrogram message that says "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you."</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/housemd.jpg">housemd.jpg</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/housemd.jpg"><br>
		This seems to be some sort of scrambled YouTube link. Unfortunately, I can't tell what it says.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/luigi.wav">luigi.wav</a></b><br>
		<audio controls><source src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/luigi.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><br>
		Yet another weird audio file. I can't really make out what's in the spectrogram, though it might be a crude drawing of something.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/mario.wav">mario.wav</a></b><br>
		<audio controls><source src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/mario.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><br>
		Yeah, there's a lot of these weird audio tracks. Upon analyzing this in a spectrogram, I found what I can only assume is an alien face.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/mario2.wav">mario2.wav</a></b><br>
		<audio controls><source src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/mario2.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><br>
		Another spectrogram image that I can't seem to make out. Unsurprisingly, it resembles a face.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/MARIOCAVE.ips">MARIOCAVE.ips</a></b><br>
		Despite the filename, it seems to be a variation of the Super MARIO Ultimatum hack.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/musical.wav">musical.wav</a></b><br>
		<audio controls><source src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/musical.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><br>
		A morse code message. When translated and reversed, it says "Its too late for her, shes gone blood."</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/pastebin.txt">pastebin.txt</a></b><br>
		Not sure what this is. It could be encoded text, though there's also a bitcoin chain with the exact same string of characters.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/ponyville.png">ponyville.png</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/ponyville.png" width="37.5%" height="37.5%"><br>
		A dark image of a town. Increasing the brightness will reveal a group of shadowy figures.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/Super%2BMARIO%2BUltimatum.ips">Super MARIO Ultimatum.ips</a></b><br>
		A variation of the "Super MARIO Ultimatum" hack.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/symbol.jpg">symbol.jpg</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/symbol.jpg" width="50%"><br>
		As the name suggests, its a symbol. This seems to be another <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/trek/caver/page1.html">Ted the Caver</a> image.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/The%2BGreat%2BCave%2BTrek.ips">The Great Cave Trek.ips</a></b><br>
		The second version of the Great Cave Trek hack.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/the_lord_is_waiting_to_take_your_hand.gif">the_lord_is_waiting_to_take_your_hand.gif</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/the_lord_is_waiting_to_take_your_hand.gif"><br>
		A GIF that cycles through a bunch of billiard balls. The number order is 1,15,2,14,3,13,4,12,5,11,6,10,7,9,8. These are apparently taken from Homestuck.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/time%2B02.jpg">time 02.jpg</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/time%2B02.jpg" width="37.5%"><br>
		A strange contemporary painting. This likely holds some sort of significance.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/victim1.txt">victim1.txt</a></b><br>
		The description of Victim #1's death/crime scene. This same piece of text is also present in the original MARIO hack.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/victim2.jpg">victim2.jpg</a></b><br>
		<img src="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/victim2.jpg"><br>
		A... smiley face? I guess the filename is just bait.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/victim2.txt">victim2.txt</a></b><br>
		The description of Victim #2's death.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/24537/victim3.txt">victim3.txt</a></b><br>
		A (very disturbing) description of Victim #3's death.</p></div>
		
		<div id="SMWCentral Posts"><h2>SMWCentral Posts</h2>
		
		<p>Time to look into some of the posts they've made on their accounts.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=44007&page=5&pid=703999#p703999">[Image]</a></b><br>
		The original image link is dead, but according to another forum member, brightening the photo by 333 times resulted in <a href="https://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu53/Uhrix/333.jpg">this</a>.</p>
		
		<p><b><i><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=46505&page=1&pid=742914#p742914">"HEllo? yvette? are you there? I have to tell tou about SomethiNg very impOrTant. it has to do about catHERinE. i am worried about he"</a></i></b><br>
		If you take the capitalized letters from this it spells out "HESNOTHERE".</p>
		
		<p><b><i><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=48937&page=3&pid=799174#p799174">"There wasn't even a first time. But sorry for making things too hard on you. Next time I post pictures of my family I'll make sure to uncover Yvette's eyes so you can see Catherine's voice in a crystal clear tone.
		<br>
		Her voice is heavenly, spectral."</a></i></b><br>
		<br>
		Maybe Yvette and Catherine were family members? This sure seems to hint at it, and it would explain MARIO's obsession with them.</p>
		
		<p><b><i><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=48937&page=3&pid=799916#p799916">"But she is already here."</a></i></b><br>
		Since "being with us" is often used to describe someone in the afterlife, I'm going to guess that one of them died.</p>
		
		<p><b><i><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=50718&page=1&pid=824701#p824701">"Wishin' everybody a happy 9/11. KEEP ON ROCKIN'<br><br>
		GOD BLESS AMERCA EVRYBODY"</a></i></b><br>
		One of two posts of them "celebrating" 9/11. I don't know why they did this, though it probably has something to do with them getting banned.</p>
		
		<p><b><i><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=53859&page=2&pid=881027#p881027">"I'll take my stupid games to real life and become the riddler"</a></i></b><br>
		They know exactly what they're doing.</p></div>
		
		<div id="Other Findings"><h2>Other Findings</h2>
		
		<p>Though these aren't as major as the rest of the things I've found, I thought they still deserved to be mentioned here.</p>

		This could be one of their alts, given that "time" was referenced several times in both MARIO's files and in their Great Cave Trek hack. Aside from that, nothing else points to this account belonging to them.</p>
		
		<p><b><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=45372">M A R I O 6 6 6</a></b><br>
		A possible, though unlikely alt. It was made more recently than the others and was last active close to August 1st.</p>

			<p>This channel only has one video, simply titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ehVvRbzbQ">..wmv</a>".

			<p><b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/M-A-R-I-O_/comments/12nmgiu/just_find/">JUST FIND</a></b><br>

		<p>Hidden in the HTML of M A R I O's current SMWCentral account is a link to their <a href="https://twitter.com/MARIOsmwcentral">Twitter</a>. Many of their tweets are vague messages, describing the "transmission". The one that sticks out however, is the ID to a YouTube video, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ccw--5Q-nM">transmission start</a>.</p></div>
